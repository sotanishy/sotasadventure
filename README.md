### World Map

![World map image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sotanishy/sotasadventure/master/resources/example/worldmap.png)

On upper left corner of the map, the heart, the gem, and the coin, and numbers next to them show the number of the player's lives remaining, the number of earned gems, and the number of earned coins, respectively.

Also on the upper left corner, there is a gray button with a light bulb picture. When you click it, it will show you [how to operate](#howtooperate) the player.

Click one of buttons on the map to play the game. Each button represents a stage. This game contains 7 stages: North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Antarctica.

A blue button means that the stage is already cleared. A red button means that the stage has not been cleared yet, but you can play the stage. A black button means that the stage has not been cleared yet and you have to clear the previous stage to play this one.

### Stage

Just like the world map, there are the heart, the gem, and the coin pictures.

On the upper right corner, there is a clock picture. It indicates the time remaining. When it reaches zero, the game will be over.

As you can see in the picture above, coins are scattered all over the stage. Collect 100 coins to gain a life.

If the player hits an enemy, the pink monster in the picture, the player will lose HP. If the HP hits zero, the game will be over and the player will lose a life. You can beat enemies using either a gun or a sword. If you beat an enemy, a gem will show up. Collect 10 gems to gain a life.

To enter the door, press &#x2191;.

In the last picture, you can see a gigantic pink monster. It is the "Space Ship". It deploys enemies once in several seconds. When you beat it, the stage will be cleared.
